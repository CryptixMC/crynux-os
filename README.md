# crynux-os
Crynux-os will be designed around modularity, making each application its own container for easier dependencies and configs all in the same spot. it will also feature combo boxes that allow multiple app containers in a single box for specific environments. imagine it as if the app containers are appliences in each room, and each combo box is the room that all the appliences are in. the purpose is to make it so when you need to program u open the programming box, and gaming, etc. each container should have access just to what it needs and when the applications are removed the configs get removed aswell.
